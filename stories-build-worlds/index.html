<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories build worlds, and worlds live through stories.<br>
This collaborative project explores the persistence of multiple stories–beginning with the original, Indigenous stories of this land and including many more–and the complex, conflicting worlds that they create and re-create with ongoing iteration. We will examine specific narratives that are close to home, on Haverford campus and in Philadelphia; as well as those that reveal the “universal,” across time and place; and the deeply personal. Events include workshops on oral history, Indigenous consultation, and land acknowledgment; and presentations by Indigenous contemporary artists and performers, including a staged reading of Beth Piatote’s play AntÃ­koni. Through these programs, we aim to uncover how Indigenous and settler-colonial subjects narrate their relations to other beings and to place; the meanings and possibilities of persistence; and how to ethically respond to the multiplicity of stories that live in the land, and with us, and inside us.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<p>An excerpt from the We Are the Seeds Santa Fe 2019 welcome letter:<br>
â€‹<br>
At Seeds, our intention is to create programs that uplift and center Indigenous voices. The time has come where we, as Indigenous people need to share our own stories, in our own ways. It is imperative for our survival. Seeds is committed to providing that opportunity whether it’s here in Santa Fe, through our programs in Philadelphia, or at the dinner table with our families.</p>
<p>It’s been a long road to get to this place and we are just beginning. As Indigenous women and mothers, we have a visceral approach to our work. Yes, we have strategies, business plans, and a support team that we are so thankful for, but the truth is, experience, too many challenges, and age have given us gifts that surpass any of those things. Seeds is for our people. Seeds is for our children. Seeds is for the future. And today, we share all of what we have with you. We want you to experience the joy we feel, the beauty we have understood since the beginning of time, and the depth of emotion with which we walk through this world. Celebrate, share, engage, learn, laugh, eat, sing, play, dance, feel. This is our wish for you. This is our wish for us. Together.<br>
Tailinh + Paula</p>

<p>Beth Piatote is an associate professor of Native American studies at the University of California, Berkeley. She holds a PhD from Stanford University, is the author of numerous scholarly essays and creative works, and is the recipient of multiple awards and fellowships.  </p>
<p>Her most recent publication ‘The Beadworkers Stories’ was published in October 2019:</p>
<p>“Beth Piatote’s luminous debut collection opens with a feast, grounding its stories in the landscapes and lifeworlds of the Native Northwest, exploring the inventive and unforgettable pattern of Native American life in the contemporary world</p>
<p>Told with humor, subtlety, and spareness, the mixed-genre works of Beth Piatote’s first collection find unifying themes in the strength of kinship, the pulse of longing, and the language of return.</p>
<p>A woman teaches her niece to make a pair of beaded earrings while ruminating on a fractured relationship. An eleven-year-old girl narrates the unfolding of the Fish Wars in the 1960s as her family is propelled to its front lines. In 1890, as tensions escalate at Wounded Knee, two young men at collegeâ€•one French and the other Lakotaâ€•each contemplate a death in the family. In the final, haunting piece, a Nez Perceâ€“Cayuse family is torn apart as they debate the fate of ancestral remains in a moving revision of the Greek tragedy Antigone.</p>
<p>Formally inventive and filled with vibrant characters, The Beadworkers draws on Indigenous aesthetics and forms to offer a powerful, sustaining vision of Native life.”<br>

<p>//////////////</p>
<p>Anna Tsouhlarakis works in sculpture, installation, video, and performance.  She is interested in challenging and redefining the boundaries of aesthetic and conceptual expectations within Native American art.  It is her goal to make work that speaks to and from Natives and create dialogues that utilize unexpected vehicles to help grow the trajectory of Native American art.</p>
<p>Tsouhlarakis is of Greek descent and an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation.</p>
<p>Tsouhlarakis received her BA from Dartmouth College with degrees in Native American Studies and Studio Art. She went on to receive her MFA from Yale University with a focus in Sculpture. </p>
<p>Tsouhlarakis has participated in various art residencies including Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Yaddo, and was the Andrew W. Mellon Artist-in-Residence at Colorado College for the 2019-2020 academic year. Her work has been part of national and international exhibitions at venues such as Rush Arts in New York, the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Art Mur in Montreal, the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, Crystal Bridges Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, the Heard Museum, and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. In 2011, she was a recipient of the Eiteljorg Fellowship for Native American Fine Art.  Her recent awards include fellowships from the Harpo Foundation, the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, and the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation. Tsouhlarakis’s work appears in several anthologies of Native American art including the recently published Art for a New Understanding: Native Voices from 1950 to Now. The book accompanies the exhibition which is “the first exhibition to chart the development of contemporary Indigenous art in the United States and Canada”.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>What is a land acknowledgment statement? Why are these statements publicly delivered in some spaces and not others? Are these statements purely performative and thus, problematic? </p>
<p>In this workshop, Akoawt Educational Initiative co-founders Chris Newell (Passamaquoddy) and endawnis Spears (DinÃ©/ Ojibwe/ Chickasaw/ Choctaw) will give context to the practice of land acknowledgment statements and how the processes of crafting and using one can be a catalyst for greater change.  Identifying actionable steps an institution or organization can take to create cultures of equity is vital to real and sustainable change. Akomawt educators will facilitate an interactive workshop about these necessary changes, best practices, and resources for implementing a land acknowledgment statement that reflects the ongoing work towards making right relations with contemporary Indigenous communities. </p>
<p>This event is free and open to the public. In addition to the workshop at 4:30, there will be an open lunch with endawnis Spears and Chris Newell at 12-1pm.</p>
<p>endawnis Spears (DinÃ©/ Ojibwe/ Chickasaw/ Choctaw) is impassioned about the diverse and complex intersections of Native American narratives and museums.  She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from the University of Denver and will complete her Master’s degree also in Anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst next year.  endawnis has worked for the Heard Museum, the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, the Muscogee Creek Nation of Oklahoma, the Narragansett Indian Tribe and was a Peabody Essex Museum Native American Arts and Culture Fellow.  In late 2019, she was elected to the Federation of State Humanities Councils’ Board of Directors.  The federation is a national organization partnering all state humanities councils and supporting grassroots humanities programming in every state and territory.  She is the Director of Outreach and Programming and founding member of the Akomawt Educational Initiative, an Indigenous education support service  and interpretive consultancy.  Originally from Camp Verde, Arizona, she lives in Rhode Island with her husband Cassius Spears Jr., and their four children, Nizhoni,  Sowaniu, Giizhig, and Tishominko.</p>
<p>Chris Newell (Passamaquoddy) is a lifetime educator. He was born and raised in Motahkmikuhk (Indian Township, ME) and a proud citizen of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.  Chris’s education career began immediately after high school as a substitute teacher during his time as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College. He’s a long time member of the Mystic River singers, an internationally acclaimed and award winning intertribal pow wow drum group based out of Connecticut. For over two decades, Chris devoted much of his time to Mystic River travelling all over the US and Canada singing at community pow wows and spending time in those communities learning various Native musics. Chris earned an interdisciplinary Bachelor of General Studies degree from the University of Connecticut which propelled him back to educating as a profession. He served for six years as the Education Supervisor for the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center where his team has led the group experience for over 50,000 guests. Out of the museum, Chris and his museum colleagues co-founded the Akomawt Educational Initiative as a response to observations of the public school system and the lack of representation of Native history and social studies. Chris combines his music and education disciplines together and often makes presentations that educate, but also entertain. Along with his work in education, Chris has also appeared in feature films and was the Senior Advisor on the documentary Dawnland chronicling the historic first ever government sanctioned Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the State of Maine.  He’s also been recognized by the New England Museum Association with a 2019 Excellence Award.  His dedication to this work goes back to his experiences at Dartmouth. He is a second generation Native educator looking to change our world for the better.  </p>

Rebecca Sockbeson (Penobscot) writes, ‘This diagram reflects the colonial concept of land ownership: packaged up into little squares, as though one can compartmentalize a way of life and sell it.’ </p>

<p>A live staged reading of Beth Piatote’s original play “Antikoni” will be performed in the VCAM building at Haverford College. This will be the second version of the play, which was first performed in UC Berkeley’s Hearst Museum of Anthropology on November 6th, 2018. Indiginous performers from New York City and Berkeley will be brought in to re-imagine this performance in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>“What do the living owe the dead, what are the moral limits of the State, and by what codes do we define what it means to be human? In this modern, haunting adaptation of Sophocles’ classic tragedy Antigone, a Native American family is torn apart as they struggle over the fate of ancestral remains and their conflicting loyalties to different notions of tradition, law, and the price of sacrifice.”</p>
